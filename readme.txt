Database Design

For this application, we will need the following tables:

User: This table will store the user's email and password.

Event: This table will store information about the events, such as the name, location, and date.

Interest: This table will store information about the user's interest in a particular event. It will have a foreign key to the User and Event tables.

Rating: This table will store the ratings given by the user for a particular event. It will have a foreign key to the User and Event tables.



Business Logic

When a user logs in, the application will check the email and password against the User table. If they match, the user will be allowed to access the event list page.

On the event list page, the user will be able to view all the upcoming events.

The user can show interest in a particular event by clicking on a "show interest" button. This will create a new record in the Interest table with the user's email and the event's ID.

The user can rate an event by clicking on a "rate" button. This will create a new record in the Rating table with the user's email, the event's ID, and the rating.

The event list page will show the average rating and the number of users interested in each event. This information will be obtained by querying the Rating and Interest tables and aggregating the data.
